# Portfolio
Compilation of programming projects

# Project 1 Home Price Predictor
* Developed a decision tree regression model, using the sklearn library in Python, that predicted the price of a home based on its state/territory, number of bedrooms, and size in square feet.
* Cleaned data in a csv file that contained information on over 900,000 homes in 18 different states and territories in the United States

# Project 2 Covid-19 Tracker
* Created a program that manipulated data that monitored the spread of Covid-19 across the globe during the first year of the pandemic using data from the Novel Coronavirus 2019 dataset.
* Scripted the program in Python using Google Colab and includes the libraries Matplotlib, Pandas, & Numpy.
* Searched for trends in the data for example, is there a rise in infections in colder climates

# Project 3 Monopoly 
* Designed a simplified version of monopoly in the programming language  C
* Players start with an initial balance and roll two dice to work their way around the board and buy properties. If a player lands on a property owned by another player they must pay the player that owns that property. If they aren’t able to pay the money owed they’re eliminated.
* The program works with arrays and pointers 

# Project 4 Election Simulator
* Manufactured a Python program that simulated ranked choice voting.
* Created classes and class methods to develop the functionality of the program
* Implemented a queue data structure to maximize the efficiency of the program
